## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to find continuous gravitational-wave signals. 

You will develop a model sensitive enough to detect weak yet long-lasting signals emitted by rapidly-spinning neutron stars within noisy data.

Your work will help scientists detect something new: a second class of gravitational waves! 

The first gravitational wave discoveries earned a Nobel Prize. 

Further study of these waves may enable scientists to learn about the structure of the most extreme stars in our universe.
